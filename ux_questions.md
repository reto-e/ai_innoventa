Here are 5 questions I would ask a potential customer to identify their needs, wishes, and requirements when planning a barbecue party:

1. What is the occasion for this barbecue party? (e.g., birthday, anniversary, graduation) And how many guests do you plan to invite?
2. Can you walk me through your typical process for planning a barbecue party? Do you have any specific traditions or rituals that you like to follow?
3. What are some of the most important factors to consider when planning a barbecue party in terms of food, drinks, and activities? Are there any must-haves or non-negotiables for you?
4. How do you currently manage invitations, RSVPs, and coordination with your guests when it comes to a barbecue party? Do you have any favorite methods or tools that make it easier for you?
5. What are some potential roadblocks or stressors that you might encounter while planning this barbecue party? Are there any specific challenges or concerns that you'd like to overcome?

These questions will help me understand the customer's context, habits, and priorities when it comes to planning a barbecue party, which will ultimately inform the design of an effective solution.
